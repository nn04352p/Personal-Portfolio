                        <h3>My Journey in Finance: From Student to Sales Coordinator</h3>
                        <p>Balancing my studies at Pace University with my role as a Sales Coordinator has taught me so much about time management, leadership, and applying classroom knowledge to real-world situations. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities to grow, and I'm grateful for the journey.</p>

                        <p>Reflecting on my time leading Habitat for Humanity and volunteering at book fairs, I've learned that giving back to the community isn't just about helping others‚Äîit's about personal growth. These experiences shaped my leadership style and taught me the value of empathy and connection.</p>

                        <p>Making the Dean's List for two consecutive semesters with a 3.75 GPA wasn't just about studying hard‚Äîit was about staying organized, setting clear goals, and maintaining balance. Here's what I learned about success in college and how it translates to professional life.</p>

                        <p>Transitioning from managing the jewelry department at Kohl's to becoming a Sales Coordinator at Holiday Inn Express taught me that core skills like customer service, inventory management, and team leadership are transferable across industries.

Studying finance at Pace University's Lubin School of Business has given me the tools to turn that fascination into a career path I'm passionate about.</p>

                        <p>Whether it's leading a sales department or managing a retail team, I've discovered that great leadership isn't about control‚Äîit's about empowerment, clear communication, and creating an environment where everyone can succeed. These are the principles I carry with me every day.</p>
